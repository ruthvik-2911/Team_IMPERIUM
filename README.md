 **Intelligent Traffic Optimization Algorithm using Machine Learning Technologies**
    
    -This project aims to optimize signal timings based on various factors which cause overall traffic flow to be reduced or slow.
**Key features**

    Key features of this project include:
    -Implementing the trained ML model into a map-based website for better readability and scalability
    -Inclusion of Real-Time Data for dynamic and adaptive signal change.
    -Calculating traffic flow based on Congestion of the road
    -Average Speed at which the vehicle crosses the signal
    -Time of the day
    -Weather and climatic conditions at the time of the day
**Technologies used**

    -Machine Learning Techniques (Decision Learning based on Regression)
    -Using Python modules(Scikit for ML, Pandas for data reading)
    -Sqlite3(For Data Base storage and Management)
    -Html,CSS for the Frontend Website
    -JavaScript, Flask for Backend of website
